## General Information
- Problem statement: To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 
  Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts 
  for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert 
  dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of 
  manual effort needed in diagnosis..

- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, 
  which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). 
  All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all 
  subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of 
  melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant..


## Conclusions

- We can infer that the Model is fit with a good enough accuracy for both Train and 
  Validation Data of max accuracy around 80% Rectifying the Class Imbalance and 
  performing Data augumentation on the dataset has resulted in a model with higher 
  accuracy and overcoming overfitting This is a good model to be used to predict 
  Skin Cancer using CNN
